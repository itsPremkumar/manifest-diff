## What it does

Spotting what changed between two agent manifests by eye is error-prone. Manifest Diff solves this: Diff two agent/skill manifests and report capability, permission, and version changes.

**Best for:** Agent reviewers and platform teams managing versions.

## Features

- **Diff two manifests**
- **See capability changes**
- **Flag permission deltas**
- **Catch version downgrades**
- **JSON output for CI**

## Install

```bash
# Requires Python 3.8+. No pip install needed.
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/itsPremkumar/manifest-diff/main/manifest_diff.py
# Or copy the file anywhere — it's self-contained.
```

## Quick start

```bash
python manifest_diff.py self-test     # prove it works end-to-end
python manifest_diff.py diff --help   # diff subcommand
```

## Use cases

1. Diff two manifests
1. See capability changes
1. Flag permission deltas
1. Catch version downgrades
1. JSON output for CI

## Why choose this over alternatives

| Alternative | Why this skill is better |
|---|---|
| Reading both files | Automatic delta report. |
| diff on raw JSON | Semantic, not textual. |
| Guessing risk | Permission deltas surfaced explicitly. |
